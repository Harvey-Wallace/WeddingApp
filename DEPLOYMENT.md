## Environment Variables Explained

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Production | Your Cloudinary cloud name (from dashboard) |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Production | Your Cloudinary API key (from dashboard) |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Production | Your Cloudinary API secret (from dashboard) |
| `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER` | Optional | Custom folder name (e.g., "sarah-and-john-wedding") |

**Note**: The app works without Cloudinary credentials for testing, but photos won't be permanently stored.

## üìÅ Photo Organization in Cloudinary

Your wedding photos will be automatically organized in Cloudinary with this structure:

```
your-wedding-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-08-10/          (photos uploaded on Aug 10)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1691234567890-abc123.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1691234567891-def456.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-08-11/          (photos uploaded on Aug 11)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1691321234567-ghi789.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Benefits of this organization:**
- **Easy browsing** by date in Cloudinary dashboard
- **Automatic tagging** with 'wedding', 'guest-upload', and date
- **Quick filtering** to find photos from specific days
- **Metadata preservation** including original filename and upload timestamp

**To customize the main folder name:**
Add `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_FOLDER=your-custom-name` to your environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Check the Railway build logs in your dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Make sure your Node.js version is compatible (18+ recommended)

### Upload Issues
- Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for upload logs
- Look at Railway logs for error details

### Performance
- Railway automatically handles scaling
- For high traffic, consider upgrading your Railway plan
- Monitor your S3 usage and costs

## Cost Estimates

### Railway
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month (perfect for weddings)
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month (if you need more resources)

### Cloudinary
- **Free Tier**: 25GB storage + 25GB bandwidth monthly (perfect for most weddings!)
- **Paid Plans**: Start at $89/month if you exceed free tier
- **Typical wedding**: Free tier should cover hundreds of photos easily

## Security Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files to GitHub
2. **S3 Permissions**: Only give minimum required permissions
3. **Domain**: Use HTTPS (Railway provides this automatically)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for production use

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test the app** with a few photos
2. **Share the URL** with a small group first
3. **Monitor Railway dashboard** for any issues
4. **Check S3 bucket** to confirm photos are uploading

Your wedding photo sharing app will be live and ready for guests to use! üéâ
